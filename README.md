# Lecture Notes

Since my first year of undergraduate studies, I have enjoyed taking handwritten notes during lectures. As I graduated from the University of Toronto, I transferred my notes to electronic format using LaTeX. These notes are stored in this repository.

The courses I have already finished or plan to work on include: STA414.
